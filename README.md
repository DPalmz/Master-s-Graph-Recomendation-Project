# Master-s-Graph-Recomendation-Project
As a way to study knowledge graphs, I attempted to create a recommendation system using pytorch geometric


This project was my Master's thesis, I researched knowledge graphs then attempted to create my own. While I was ultimately unsucessful at adapting the Book-Crossing database into pytorch geometric, I did learn quite a bit about how to use all the component libraries.

Libraries Needed:
Pytorch,
Pytorch Geometric,
Pandas,
Numpy,
Transformers
